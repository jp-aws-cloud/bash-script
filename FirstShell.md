# Your First Shell Program

A shell script is a file containing one or more commands that you would type on the command line.

You should be in your home directory, which you can find in the variable $HOME:

```bash
echo $HOME
```

You can find the current directory with either the pwd command or the PWD variable:

```sh
pwd
echo "$PWD"
```
